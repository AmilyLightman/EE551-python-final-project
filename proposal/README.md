**Introduction**

With the development of the times, more and more people start shopping online. In a specific date, e-commerce will gives a huge discount.Such as the Black Friday in the USA and Nov 11 in China. It's hard to get what we want when so many people rush to purchase the same thing. Sometimes it will out of stock before I click the 'purchase' button. So, I would like to make a project that can automatically buy the products we have set.

need to install selenium, retry, pyautogui,chromedriver

ChromeDriver(for mac):  
mv chromedriver /usr/local/bin  
sudo chmod u+x,o+x   /usr/local/bin/chromedriver  

**Functions**

monitor function  
buy function  
retry function when buy() fails
